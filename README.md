# **3. FEATURES**

## **3.1 THE GLOBAL IRISH CAFE**

1. The website consists of 4 pages:

   [i]   It opens with a **Home** page which:
         - Gives an introduction to the site 
         - Gives user instructions on how to use the site
         - Displays one recipe from each country represented on the site, with quick links for the recipe's category and country 
         - The home page design is fixed to displaying 5 recipes, therefore it does not require pagination
       
   [ii]  The Recipes List page:
   
         - Displays a card for each recipe in the country / category, sorted by country / category
         - The recipe card shows an image and a short introduction to the recipe
         - Each recipe has a more icon which will bring the user to the recipe details
         - Each recipe has a quick link to see all recipes in the country and category of the recipe
   
   [iii] The Recipes Details page:
   
         -  Displays the selected recipe's details. If this page is called when the user is viewing their own 
            recipes, it allows them to edit or delete the recipe

   [iv]  The 'My Recipes' page allows the user to enter a new recipe, or retrieve their existing recipes by entering their email address.
         Once the email address is entered, all recipes with that email address will be displayed on the Recipes List page. The user may view, 
         edit and delete their own recipes 
   

2. The country dropdown will be disabled on the Home and My Recipes pages, and when the user is searching for recipes either by keyword or,
   from the 'My Recipes' page, by email address
3. The nav link selected by the user will change color to green, so that the user remembers which selection they have made
4. When the country dropdown is enabled, its selection will be changed to green to highlight the user's selection
5. The website displays 6 recipes per page and allows the user to paginate from one page to the next, while  highlighting the page number it is 
   currently on
6. When a recipe is input, the status and keyword are set to 'new'. It is possible to search for new recipes only by selecting 'new' from
   the 'Search By Keyword' box
7. The website uses Google fonts - Courgette and Nunito

**NOTES**
1. Bootstrap Cards are not responsive, therefore I have kept the recipe list page to 2 recipes per row. This also has an effect on the 
   bottom navbar - it does not break on smaller devices

2. images addresses??


## **3.6 NAVIGATION AND RESPONSIVENESS**

1. The top navigation bar is fixed, giving the user easy access to it at all times on all devices and allowing ease of navigation. The 
   navigation menu collapses on smaller devices
2. The selections made from the top navigation menu are changed to green, so that users remembers the selections they have made   
3. The bottom navigation bar also allows for ease of navigation. The Social Media icons (facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube) appear on
   the bottom navigation bar, and they open in a new tab
4. Bootstrap Recipe cards are not responsive, therefore I have limited them on the Recipe List page to two per row. These show okay on all 
   devices. However this means that the bottom navigation bar does not break on smaller devices 
5. Clicking on the site's logo takes the user back to the home page
